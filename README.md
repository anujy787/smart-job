## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Finding the right job or candidate in today's fast-paced job market is a complex and time-consuming process. Many job board applications lack personalized recommendations, efficient search mechanisms, and real-time notifications, leading to frustration among both job seekers and employers.
