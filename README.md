# SmartJob - A Dynamic Job Board Application

## üìå Project Group Number: 9

## üöÄ Overview
SmartJob is an innovative job board application designed to simplify and enhance the job search and recruitment process. By offering a seamless and feature-rich platform, SmartJob connects job seekers with employers efficiently, ensuring an optimal hiring experience for both parties.

## üéØ Problem Statement
Finding the right job or candidate in today's fast-paced job market is a complex and time-consuming process. Many job board applications lack personalized recommendations, efficient search mechanisms, and real-time notifications, leading to frustration among both job seekers and employers. Additionally, managing job postings, applications, and communication within a single platform often results in inefficiencies and poor user experience. Our solution, SmartJob, aims to bridge this gap by providing a feature-rich, scalable, and intelligent job board application. By incorporating modern software engineering principles, SmartJob ensures a seamless, user-friendly experience with dynamic job recommendations, real-time alerts, and secure interactions. This project will not only streamline the hiring process but also create an engaging and efficient platform for all users.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Patterns

SmartJob implements several design patterns to ensure maintainable, scalable, and extensible code:

### 1. Factory Pattern
- **JobPostFactory**: Creates different types of job posts (Full-time, Part-time, Remote, Internship)
- **UserFactory**: Creates different types of users (JobSeeker, Employer)
- **SearchStrategyFactory**: Creates search strategies based on search type for jobs
- **ApplicationSearchStrategyFactory**: Creates search strategies for job applications

### 2. Builder Pattern
- **JobPostBuilder**: Constructs job post objects with many optional parameters

### 3. Command Pattern
- **JobPostCommand**: Interface defining commands for job posts
- **UpdateJobPostCommand**: Executes job post update operation
- **DeletePostCommand**: Executes job post delete operation
- **JobPostInvoker**: Invokes the appropriate command

### 4. Strategy Pattern
- **SearchStrategy<T>**: Generic interface defining search behavior
- **TitleSearchStrategy**: Searches jobs by title
- **CompanySearchStrategy**: Searches jobs by company
- **LocationSearchStrategy**: Searches jobs by location
- **ApplicationTitleSearchStrategy**: Searches applications by job title
- **ApplicationCompanySearchStrategy**: Searches applications by company name
- **ApplicationLocationSearchStrategy**: Searches applications by location
- **SearchContext<T>**: Sets and executes the appropriate search strategy

### 5. Observer Pattern
- **NotificationObserver**: Interface for notification observers
- **JobSeekerNotificationObserver**: Concrete observer for job seekers
- **NotificationSubject**: Subject that notifies observers of events

### 6. State Pattern
- **ApplicationState**: Interface for job application states
- **AppliedState**: Represents the 'applied' state
- **InReviewState**: Represents the 'in review' state
- **HiredState**: Represents the 'hired' state
- **RejectedState**: Represents the 'rejected' state
- **WithdrawnState**: Represents the 'withdrawn' state

### 7. Adapter Pattern
- **JobApplicationEmailAdapter**: Adapts the EmailService for specific job application emails

### 8. Singleton Pattern
- Spring beans are singletons by default, including services and repositories

### 9. Dependency Injection
- Used throughout the application via Spring's @Autowired annotation

### 10. Repository Pattern
- All database access is abstracted through repositories (JobPostRepository, UserRepository, etc.)
